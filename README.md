Problem Statement: With increasing public safety concerns, monitoring compliance with safety measures like mask-wearing in real-time is crucial. This project aims to enhance public surveillance systems by integrating automated face and mask detection capabilities, enabling timely detection of non-compliant individuals and assisting authorities in maintaining public health protocols.

Methodology: The system is implemented in Python, featuring two distinct modules: a face detection module and a mask detection module. The face detection module utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and capture images when a face is detected, displaying a "face detected" notification on the screen. The mask detection module then assesses the detected face, calculating the percentage of mask coverage. If a mask is present, the coverage percentage is displayed; otherwise, the system issues a prompt for the user to wear a mask. This dual-module approach allows for efficient and proactive monitoring, ensuring compliance with mask-wearing protocols in public spaces.
